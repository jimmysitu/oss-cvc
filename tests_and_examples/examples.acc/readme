To test PLI 1.0 acc_ interface:

BEFORE STARTING:
   Make sure binary CVC is installed in bin directory 2 levels up
   (../../bin/cvc) and run the shell script in install.test directory to
   verify correct installation of CVC.

When compiling a design for use with the PLI you may need to compile with
+acc+[level] command.  This option compiles with the following levels of
PLI access:

        +acc+1 or +acc
         Enable all PLI capabilities except value change callbacks and
         delay annotation.
        +acc+2
         All features above plus value change callbacks.
        +acc+3
         All features above plus module path delay.
        +acc+4
         All features above plus gate delay annotation.
 
We are working on VCS style .tab file for more specific access options to 
increase peformance when using the PLI.

HOW TO RUN THE TEST SCRIPT

1) Run the shell script inst_pli.sh.  Various compiler and Verilog
   output messages will be printed but there should be no diff command
   differences printed.  

   The commands to run CVC with dynamically loaded user PLI library
   explicitly access the user .so library in this directory.  For your
   PLI libraries, it is better to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
   variables so explicit "./" is not needed

2) After completing the test, you can run clean.sh to remove work files.
   The inst_pli.sh script removes each PLI library .so dynamic library after
   running the test that uses it so unless something went wrong, you
   do not need to run clean.sh.  

3) Use makefile.lnx as a template for your PLI programs.
