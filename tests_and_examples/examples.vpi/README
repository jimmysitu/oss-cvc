       PLI 2.0 VPI ROUTINE EXAMPLES AND INSTALLATION TEST

This directory contains PLI 2.0 API vpi_ routine examples to illustrate use 
of PLI 2.0.  To test for correct installation run the inst_pli.sh script that
compiles vpi_ programs into .so libraries which are dynamically loaded
using +loadvpi= CVC command line option and run.


When compiling a design for use with the PLI you may need to compile with
+acc+[level] command.  This option compiles with the following levels of
PLI access:

        +acc+1 or +acc
         Enable all PLI capabilities except value change callbacks and
         delay annotation.
        +acc+2
         All features above plus value change callbacks.
        +acc+3
         All features above plus module path delay.
        +acc+4
         All features above plus gate delay annotation.
 
We are working on VCS style .tab file for more specific access options to 
increase peformance when using the PLI.

The PLI routine vpi_put_value cannot be called with the non standard 
reason flag vpiAddDriver when running in compiled mode.  To use this you need
to run in interpreted mode (+interp).

To see an example asynchronously driven PLI 2.0 vpi_ model, look
at async.c (and async.v) test below.  The other tests show various
PLI 2.0 vpi_ routine capabilities but are not complete models.

To learn more about PLI 2.0 capabilities, read the various examples.  To
learn how to use a particular vpi_ routine, access method, or to get
properties from a particular object, run "grep [object or routine name] *.c".

HOW TO RUN THE TEST SCRIPT

1) Run the shell script inst_pli.sh.  Various compiler and Verilog
   output messages will be printed but there should be no diff command
   differences printed.  

   By convention makefile.lnx assumes this test is run in release
   directory tree with include files in pli_incs 2 directory levels up
   and CVC binary also 2 levels up.

   The commands to run CVC with dynamically loaded user PLI library
   explicitly access the user .so library in this directory.  For your
   PLI libraries, it is better to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
   variables so explicit "./" is not needed

2) After completing the test, run clean.sh to remove work files.
   The inst_pli.sh script removes each PLI library .so dynamic library after
   running the test that uses it so unless something went wrong, you
   do not need to run clean.sh.  

3) Use makefile.lnx as a template for your vpi_ PLI 2.0 models.
   Notice to use the PLI1 user defined PLI system/task function interface,
   you must use +loadpli1= option.  To use newer PLI2 vpi_ user defined PLI
   system/task function interface you must use +loadvpi=.  You should
   use the +loadvpi= option for all new PLI code because of the additional
   capabilities.  +loadpli1= system tasks can't be used with new vpi_
   system task and function access methods because +loadpli1 system tasks
   and functions must support old behavior.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tests are:

  1. async.c is asynchronously switching not gate implemented using vpi_.

  2. vhello1.c and vhello2.c are "hello world" tests that also show use
     of environment determing vpi_ routines.

  3. vhelbad.c is a "hello world" test with some vpi_ errors to illustrate
     vpi_ error checking.

  4. findcaus.c is test that traverses Verilog design hierarchy.

  5. vcabtsts.c is a test that registers every call back and prints a message
     when it occurs.

  6. vprtchg.c adds cbValueChange callbacks to every .v file varaibles and
     prints a message on every change.

  7. vprtchg2.c test also prints every variable change in a design
     except it uses vpi_get_value and vpi_get_time instead of the built in
     value change callback values.

  8. vprtchg3.c prints new and old variable values using an on change call
     back.

  9. vprtdels.c accesses and prints every delay in a design.

  10. vprtdel2.c illustrates vpi_ timscale handling.

  11. vsetdels.c use vpi_ to set delays.

  12. vsetval1.c tests various vpi_put_value uses.

  13. vtimcbs.c illustrates use of various delay callbacks.

  14. vfopen1.c implements $fopen built in system function using PLI 2.0.

  15. vfopen2.c is  variant of the vfopen1.c test using vpi_ system task
      instead of vpi_ system function.

  16. vconta1.c tests continous assignments and non lvalue expression
      decomposition.

  17. vchkprt1.c tests most port and vpiHighConn/vpiLowConn one to one
      and one to many iterators.  It is possible that either the .c model
      or CVC's interpretation of the LRM are not right because CVC
      assumes all bit iterators are LSB to MSB in terms of vpi_scan order.

  18. vdrvld1.c tests vpiDriver and vpiLoad iterators for nets.

  19. vdrvld2.c tests vpiDriver and vpiLoad iterators for bits of nets.

  20. dfpsetd.c tests vpi_put_value to defparam and specparam during
      cbEndOfCompile call back for delay annotation (allows delay annotation
      to procedural delay controls and continuous assignments).  Test
      sets same delays and produces same results using vpi_ as dfpsetd.vc
      in install.test directory that uses 2 SDF delay annotation files.
