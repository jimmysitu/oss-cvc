///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


See either the IEEE P1364 Verilog standard LRM that can be purchased from
IEEE or a book on Verilog to learn Verilog syntax and usage.

For people with experience simulating with Verilog, best approach is probably
to study the Verilog designs and test cases in the test_and_examples directory.
Especiall see das_cpu design in the verilog_da_bnchmrks directory and
the open cores in the open_cores directory.

The documentation directory contains the following files:


oss_cvc_quick_start.pdf File containing quick start guide.  Information 
                      on using CVC and frequently asked questions.

cvc_xpropagation.pdf  File containg information on how to use CVC X-propagation.
                      

cvc_help.txt          File containing help screen that is printed by CVC
                      when "cvc -h" is typed.   This file contains
                      documentation for the most current optimization
                      options.  When new options are added, they are 
                      documented first in this help file.

dbg_help.txt          All the gdb style debugger help screens combined into
                      one file. 
                      ** NOTE - debugger only allowed when run in interpreted
                      mode (+interp).

how_to_use_new_toggle_coverage_feature.README
		      File containing information and guidance for using the
                      newly added toggle coverage feature.  Also see the
                      "cvc64 -h" verilog.log file for descriptions of the
                      new toggle coverage options.
