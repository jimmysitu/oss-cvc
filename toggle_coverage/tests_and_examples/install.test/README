               RUNNING THE CVC INSTALLATION TEST

*** BEWARE cvc and/or cvc64 must now be installed before running these
*** scripts either somewhere on your shell PATH or in /tmp

First run CVC without any arguments to make sure CVC binary is
installed.  The first line output CVC version number must match the version
of your release directory.  If the version number does not match, you probably
have your shell PATH environment variable set to execute an old version of CVC.

Run the shell command script to insure correct 32 bit installation by typing:

inst_test.sh 

Correct installation is indicated by the following message with no diff
command output lines before the message:

>>>> Install test completed (this should be only printed message).

To test 64 bit installation, type: "inst_test.sh cvc64".

To test correct interpreter installation run the inst_test_interp.sh script.
It can also take the cvc64 argument.

By convention the expected output files end with .plg (and .plg64) suffixes.
