                     RUNNING CVC X-PROPAGATION TESTS

This directory contains simple examples to illustrate how CVC X-propagation 
works along with the associated options to invoke CVC X-propagation.  For a 
complete explanation of CVC X-propagation see doc/cvc_xpropagation.pdf from
the top level directory.

 These examples are simple and mostly used 'initial' blocks to show 
X-propagation handling.  To run all examples use the 'xprop_test.sh' script.


 The examples in this directory are used to illustrates the following
functionality:

  xif.v - run with +xprop to show the Verilog semantic handling changes for
          if statements with X-propagation.

  xcase.v - run with +xprop to show the Verilog semantic handling changes for
            case statements with X-propagation.

  xnested.v - run with +xprop.  Shows some combinations for if/case statements.

  xtrace.v - run with +xprop +xtrace.   Used to show +xtrace capabilities 
             when used along with +xprop/+xprop2 will trace each time and 
             location that an if('bx) or case('bx) occurs causing X-progation
             to be entered.

  xprop2.v - run with +xprop2 to illustrate alternative X-propagation feature.

  xprop_eval.v - +xprop_eval to show X preservation across certain Verilog 
                 operators.

  xexcluded.v - +xprop +xprop_excluded.  The +xprop_exlcuded option creates
                a file called 'cvc.xprop.excluded' that includes all statements
                that are not eligible for X-propagation along with the reason.

  xconfig.v -  run with '-optconfigfile x.optconfig'.  Example show how CVC's
               '-optconfigile' can be used to only turn on X-propagation for
               specific modules.
