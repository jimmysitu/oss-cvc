It is used for Verilog simulator benchmarking.  To run your Verilog simulator 
just pass the file list.  For CVC, you would type:

 %cvc +verbose -f run.flist

 You may need to make minor changes to 'run.flist' to get it to run in your 
simulation environment or pass in the file list using the proper option
for your simulator.  The +verbose option is needed by CVC to cause
progress messages and simulation times to be printed.  To inhibit messages,
use the -q flag.
