       DPI ROUTINE EXAMPLES AND INSTALLATION TEST

This directory contains examples to illustrate how to use the SystemVerilog 
Direct Programming Interface (DPI) with CVC.  To test for correct installation
run the dpi_test.sh script that compiles DPI programs into .so libraries which 
are linked at compile time using -sv_lib [.so lib name] CVC command line 
option.

Tests are:

 1) twostate_tasks - test passing of 2-state values as input/outputs to tasks.
 2) twostate_functions - use of functions with 2-state values.
 3) fourstate - passing/setting 4-state values in DPI.
 4) export - using DPI export to call Verilog tasks from C.
 5) twostate_array - use of  2-state arrays.
 6) fourstate_array - use of 4-state arrays.
 7) reals - using reals with the DPI.
 8) selects - use built in sv* bit and part select calls.
 9) chandle - using chandle types in Verilog to pass C pointers.


Currently CVC supports the following built in SV calls from svdpi.h: 

  svDpiVersion
  svGetBitselBit
  svGetBitselLogic
  svPutBitselBit
  svPutBitselLogic
  svGetPartselBit
  svGetPartselLogic
  svPutPartselBit
  svPutPartselLogic
  svGetScope
  svSetScope
  svGetNameFromScope
  svGetScopeFromName

Not yet supported:

 'void function' - these should just be declared as tasks.
