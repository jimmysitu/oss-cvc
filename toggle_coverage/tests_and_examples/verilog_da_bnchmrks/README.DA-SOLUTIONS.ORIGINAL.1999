This directory contains the public domain Verilog test circuits from the
DA Solutions Ltd. benchmark library used in DA Solutions commercial
benchmark program back in the late 1990s.  Since DA Solutions no longer
is active, John Hillawi has kindly allowed us to make them available.

Here is contents of John's original README file:

-- This library was created by DA Solutions for the purposes
-- of benchmarking Verilog simulation products.
-- This directory contains the public domain portion of the DA
-- Solutions library. Other proprietary circuits, provided by
-- end users were also used in the evaluation, but these remain
-- confidential to the end users and DA Solutions and are not 
-- included in this release.
--
--
-- The circuits are:
--	DA Solutions CPU circuit (das_cpu)
--	DA Solutions Multiplier circuit (das_mult)
--	DA Solutions LFSR circuit (das_lfsr)
--	TI Multiplier circuit (ti_mult)
--	
-- Simple gate level libraries are also provided in the libs
-- directory. However, the user is recommended to obtain fully
-- functional libraries from the ASIC Manufacturers. with full
-- functional coding, and full timing parameters, in order to
-- exactly replicate the DA Solutions 1994 results. DA Solutions
-- has no authority to ship such libraries with this tape.

We have added a -f file to simplify execution and slightly modified
the README file for each circuit.  Otherwise the tests are exactly
as DA Solutions released them.

We have put them on our web site as a public service, and because we
are in process of publishing papers on our new byte code virtual
machine interpreter (selected using -O option) that use the
benchmark circuits for measurements.
