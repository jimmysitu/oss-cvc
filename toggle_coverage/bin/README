  The CVC binaries are now released as a separate directory because the
major release files usually change much less frequently than the CVC
binaries.  To run the install_test you must copy the version of cvc and cvc64
that corresponds to your RHEL operating system version to somewhere on
your OS executable PATH environment.

  The binaries alon with the Changlog will be in directory

    <minor version>-cvc-binaries-<date>.dir

  The binaries will be named cvc.<versions>.<EL library version>.<date>
or cvc64.<versions>.<EL library version>.<date> for cvc64. 

  If you use the PLI, the pli_incs directory in the files-release directory
must be copied to somewher on your gcc include (-I?) path.
