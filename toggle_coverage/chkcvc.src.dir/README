The checkcvc and checkcvc64 binaries are in the release bin directory.
You should just run those.  The makefile.lnx and makefile.lnx64 can be
used to make the binaries again if you need to.

If you really want to run on an old 32 bit linux OS, you need to change
makefile.lnx to not define __X86_64__.
